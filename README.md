# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
### Description
The R script (run_analysis.R) and data set included in this repo are solutions to the project problem for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.

Based on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository, data collected from accelerometers from Samsung Galaxy S smartphone are read and processed into tidy data sets that can be further analyzed as a function of subject identification (subject number), activity type (laying, walking, etc.), siganl type (time or frequency domain), sensed (eg. BodyAcceleration in X, Y, Z direction).  Measured values are mean values for each observation.
