# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
### Description
The R script (run_analysis.R) and data set included in this repo are solutions to the project problem for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.

### R Script Detail
Based on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository, data collected from accelerometers from Samsung Galaxy S smartphone are read and processed by run_analysis.R script into a tidy data set of mean values that can be further analyzed as a function of:

* subject identification (subject number)
* activity type (laying, walking, etc.)
* siganl type (time or frequency domain)
* sensed (eg. BodyAcceleration in X, Y, Z direction)

### Dataset Detail
The dataset in UCI_HAR_mean.txt has been processed into a tidy dataset and saved by the run_analysis.R script.
